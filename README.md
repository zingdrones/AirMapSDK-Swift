## Installation

### CocoaPods

Requires CocoaPods 1.0.0+

The AirMap SDK is a CocoaPod written in Swift. CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. If you don't have CocoaPods, You can install it with the following command:

`$ sudo gem install cocoapods `


### Example Project

***You must have Xcode 8.0 to run the example.***

To run the example project, run `pod try AirMapSDK`.  This should install the SDK and launch Xcode.

### Integration into Your project

To integrate the AirMap SDK into your Xcode project, navigate to the directory that contains your project and create a new **Podfile** with `pod init` or open an existing one, then add `pod ‘AirMapSDK’` to the main target. If you are using the Swift SDK, make sure to add the line `use_frameworks!`.

```ruby
use_frameworks!
target 'Your Project Target Name' do
	pod 'AirMapSDK'
end
```

Then, run the following command to install the dependency:

`$ pod install`

For Objective-C projects, set the **Embedded Content Contains Swift Code** flag in your project to **Yes** (found under **Build Options** in the **Build Settings** tab).


To interact with the AirMap SDK, make sure you **import AirMap** to the class that is utilizing the SDK methods.

```swift
import AirMap
import UIKit

class ViewController : UIViewController {

  override viewDidLoad(){
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // example of getting the current flight of the authenticated pilot.
    AirMap.getCurrentAuthenticatedPilotFlight { (flight, error) in
      ...
    }
  }
}
```
